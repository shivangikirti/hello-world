# hello-world
Contains random stuff- stuff I plan to do!

About me: I am a student currently persuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering. I am keenly interested in Machine Learning,             Cloud Computing, and love coding (in Java). However, the above fields of interest are not at all binding; I am open to any area             related to computer science, provided it is intriguing enough.
